# Collaboration

1. Every Contribution should be pushed to a separate Branch
    1. The branch naming should follow the format `<TICKET_NUMBER>/<ShortTitleInPascalCase>` so for example `20/AddPasswordEncryption`
    2. On the Issue your Branch is related to (if any) link your branch under the **Development**-segment
2. Once you want to have your code merged into `main`, open a Pull Request from your branch onto `main`
    1. After your Pull Request was reviewed and apporved after potential adjustments it, set it to **auto-merge** or press **merge**
